# Apollo Code - Vibe Coding with Silence.
Browser-based AI wrapper for coding with supression and divisioning.\
Visit our online demo: [apollo-code.github.io](https://apollo-code.github.io).

## What's innovative
+ Cuts down input token cost to 80% maximum.
+ Use comments to track changes like Apollo 11, which reduces git object access.

## Limitation
+ **Divi is not your copilot.** Divi is an independent SWE, who understands your order and writes working code. you can observe and order it, but cannot modify by yourself.

## Prequesties
Chromium-based web browser like latest Chrome/Edge/Opera, which supports FileSystem Access API.
