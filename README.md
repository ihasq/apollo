+ Use comments to track changes like Apollo 11, which reduces git object access.

## Limitation
+ **Divi is not your copilot.** Divi is an independent SWE, who understands your order and writes working code. you can observe and order it, but cannot modify by yourself.

## Prequesties
Chromium-based browser like Chrome/Edge/Opera, which supports FileSystem Access API.
