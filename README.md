# Apollo - Vibe Coder. Suppressor Included.
Browser-based AI wrapper for web development with supression and divisioning.\
Visit our browser edition without command executor: [apollo-coder.github.io](https://apollo-coder.github.io).

## What's innovative
+ Apollo aims to slash token costs by up to **88%**, just as NASA achieved a moonshot with 8-bit computers.
+ Use original logger to track changes like NASA's ancient codebase, which reduces git object access.

## Limitation
+ **Apollo is not your copilot.** Apollo is an independent web developer, who understands your order and writes working code. you can observe and order it, but cannot modify by yourself.
