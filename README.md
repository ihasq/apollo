# Apollo WebDev - Vibe Coding with Silence.
Browser-based AI wrapper for web development with supression and divisioning.\
Visit our online demo: [apollo-webdev.github.io](https://apollo-webdev.github.io).

## What's innovative
+ Cuts down input token cost to 80% maximum.
+ Use comments to track changes like NASA's ancient codebase, which reduces git object access.

## Limitation
+ **Apollo is not your copilot.** Apollo is an independent web developer, who understands your order and writes working code. you can observe and order it, but cannot modify by yourself.

## Prequesties
+ OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible LLM's valid API key. [Ask Gemini to get available LLMs](https://g.co/gemini/share/c942f13fa8ef).
+ Chromium-based latest web browser, such as Chrome/Edge/Opera, which supports FileSystem Access API.
